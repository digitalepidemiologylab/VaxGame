      <h3 id="faqHead">What is VAX?</h3>
      <div>
        <p class="faqText">
          First and foremost, Vax! is a game about epidemic prevention. It's also
          an interactive learning environment designed to visualize a process that
          strains our imagination: A contagion spreading across a network.
        </p>

        <p class="faqText">
          Players are tasked to prepare for an outbreak by vaccinating a network that resembles human social networks. After distributing vaccines, an infectious outbreak begins to spread and the player is tasked to quell the epidemic by quarantining individuals at risk of becoming infected.
        </p>

        <p class="faqText">
          Vax! is a puzzle-game infused with chance that was inspired by real-world challenges, infectious disease modeling, and addictively rewarding gameplay.

      <h3 id="faqHead">Why quarantine healthy people?</h3>
      <div >
        <p class="faqText" >
          This is epidemiology jargon that has been obscured by Hollywood. We "isolate" the sick and "quarantine" the healthy that may have been exposed. Check out the <a style="color:#2692F2" href="http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/"> CDC's article</a> on the subject.
